        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Technology & Communications</h2>
            <p>
                I am an undergraduate student at Syracuse University studying Information Management & Technology in the School
                of Information Studies (iSchool) and Visual Communication S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.<br>
                I am from many places in the United States, having been raised in a military family, which has exposed 
                me to many cultures and people throughout my childhood and now adulthood. I have lived in California, 
                Alaska, Alabama, Florida, Virginia, and now New York. My experiences have inspired me to combine my 
                passion for technology and communications. These are two fields that are extremely prevalent in todayâ€™s 
                world. I am looking for opportunities that will further my education and career and inspire me to achieve 
                my passions in life, as well as inspire others. 
                My interests include movies, shows, video games, and theatre. </p> 
        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>I also like to take many photos as a hobby.</p>
