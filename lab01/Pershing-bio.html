        Dara Pershing

I am Information Management & Technology in the iSchool and Visual Communications in Newhouse. I am thinking about making websites, but unsure what I want to do completely. 

I can code in Python. 
I am on the Deanâ€™s List.
I won the Grace Hopper Scholarship.

I love movies, shows, theater, and videogames. My favorite shows are The Office and Game of Thrones. 

Fun Fact: I have moved six times. I also have a twin brother.
